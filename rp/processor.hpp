    //! Restore the state of an Object after deserialization.
    /*! An abstract base class which implements the hooks which allow implementation
        of any post-serialization behavior that may be required.

        Each class which inherits from Object requires an associated Processor
        class.  If a given Object subclass does not have a Processor class
        explicitly configured for it then the DefaultProcessor class is used.
        To override this behavior, implement a custom class which inherits either
        from Processor or DefaultProcessor.

        The code to associate the custom Processor class with the given Object
        subclass is implemented in the constructor of class SerializationFactory.
        If you are using gensrc then you can autogenerate the required code
        by editing the XML function metadata for the relevant constructor and
        adding tag processorName.

    //! Basic support for the singleton pattern.
    /*! The typical use of this class is:
        \code
        class Foo : public Singleton<Foo> {
            friend class Singleton<Foo>;
          private:
            Foo() {}
          public:
            ...
        };
        \endcode
        which, albeit sub-optimal, frees one from the concerns of
        creating and managing the unique instance and can serve later
        as a single implemementation point should synchronization
        features be added.

        If the derived class provides an initialize() method, it will
        be called after creation of the unique instance.

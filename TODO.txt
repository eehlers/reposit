- dynamic build
- unify syntax for %rename, %rename2, %alias, ...
- support for example values (as in gensrc)

- at present, if a function parameter whose type is an enum has a default value, the default is implemented with a little hack where it is converted from a string to the enum e.g.:

"Put" -> Put

need to enhance this to allow default values for enums without having to use a string.

- gensrc does not require defaults to be last, reposit does (because it uses valid C++ syntax).

- test suite

put this into autogenerated serialization_xxx.cpp files?

#if defined BOOST_MSVC
#pragma warning(disable : 4267)     // Signed/unsigned mismatch
#endif

- refactor enumerations code

- "permanent" flag - in Excel - declare as P not L.  automatically generate default value of false.
  In the function code, convert the value from OPER to bool (instead of hard coding it to false).

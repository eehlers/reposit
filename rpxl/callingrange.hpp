        to this CallingRange object and the hidden name can be used to link back to the
        calling range even after events such as rename of the book or sheet, cut and paste, etc.

        The CallingRange object can also be queried to indicate whether the associated Excel range
        remains valid, this facilitates garbage collection of objects orphaned by the deletion
        of the calling cell.
